Hopt-o-mex is currently an incomplete Haskell port of my "opt-o-mex" c++ optimal control software.

So far I've implemented euler/rk4 integrators, dynamics linearization functions, differential dynamic programming, a visualizer, and some examples.

Automatic differentiation is currently done using "hcasadi," my haskell bindings to the CasADi C++ AD library.

See hcasadi's README for installation difficulties
